File: original-Info.plist

This a copy of this file that was installed on multiple different Mac
OSX systems I own, running several different versions of Mac OSX,
including:


File: modified-Info.plist

This is the same as original-Info.plist, but has the following line,
line 24 in original-Info.plist, deleted:

```
<string>org.openxmlformats.wordprocessingml.document</string>
```

I got the idea of trying to modify the file in this way from this
article: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8373095

I have saved a copy of that web page in this file for future
reference, in case it changes.
